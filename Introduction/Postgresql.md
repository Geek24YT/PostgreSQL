# What is PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) based on [**POSTGRES, Version 4.2**](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/postgres.html), developed at the University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Department.

POSTGRES pioneered many concepts that only became available in some commercial database systems much later.

## Some of the features of PostgreSQL:

- [**complex queries**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql.html)
- [**foreign keys**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK)
- [**triggers**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/triggers.html)
- [**updatable views**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html#SQL-CREATEVIEW-UPDATABLE-VIEWS)
- [**transactional integrity**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html)
- [**multiversion concurrency control**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc.html)

Also, PostgreSQL can be extended by the user in many ways, for example by adding new

- [**data types**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html)
- [**functions**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions.html)
- [**operators**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions.html)
- [**aggregate functions**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)
- [**index methods**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes.html)
- [**procedural languages**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/server-programming.html)

PostgreSQL can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone free of charge for any purpose, be it private, commercial, or academic.
