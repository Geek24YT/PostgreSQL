In this example we will be creating a simple Table named Weather.

This table will be having 5 columns:

1. city
2. temp_lo
3. temp_hi
4. prcp
5. date

<!-- temp_lo is low temperature -->
<!-- temp_hi is high temperature -->
<!-- prcp is  precipitation -->

We can enter this into psql with the line breaks. psql will recognize that the command is not terminated until the semicolon.

`CREATE TABLE weather (
    city            varchar(80),
    temp_lo         int,          
    temp_hi         int,          
    prcp            real,         
    date            date
);`
