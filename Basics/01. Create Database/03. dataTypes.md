### 1. Character Types

These are used for storing text data:

`char(n):` Fixed-length character string of length n.
Example: char(5) stores exactly 5 characters (padded with spaces if shorter).

`varchar(n):` Variable-length character string with a maximum length of n.
Example: varchar(50) can store up to 50 characters.

`text:` Variable-length character string without a specific limit.
Example: Use when you don't know or care about the length.

### 2. Numeric Types

Used for storing numbers:

`smallint:` A small-range integer (-32,768 to 32,767).

`int/integer:` A standard-range integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).

**In PostgreSQL, int and integer are completely interchangeable—they are synonyms for the same data type. You can use either in your SQL queries, and they will function identically.**

`CREATE TABLE a (id int);      -- Using int`

`CREATE TABLE b (id integer);  -- Using integer`

Internally, PostgreSQL treats int and integer the same, with these characteristics:

It is a 4-byte (32-bit) signed integer.
Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

`int (or integer)` cannot store a phone number like 9900000000, because the number exceeds the maximum range of int (2,147,483,647).

solution: Use `bigint`

`bigint:` A large-range integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807).

`decimal(p, s)/numeric(p, s):` Exact precision numbers. p is the total number of digits, and s is the number of digits after the decimal.
Example: `numeric(5, 2)` can store numbers like 123.45 or -12.34.

5 is the total number of digits that the number can have (both before and after the decimal point, including the digits for the negative sign if applicable).

2 is the number of digits allowed after the decimal point.

Example:
With numeric(5, 2), you can store numbers like:

`123.45` → Total digits = 5 (12345), 2 digits after the decimal.

`-12.34` → Total digits = 4 (1234 including the negative sign), 2 digits after the decimal.

`99.99 `→ Total digits = 4 (9999), 2 digits after the decimal.

However, the number 1234.56 won't fit, because it has 6 total digits (which exceeds 5).

<br/>

`real:` A single-precision floating-point number (approx. 6 decimal places).

In PostgreSQL, the real data type is a single-precision floating-point number, meaning:

It uses 4 bytes (32 bits) of storage.

It can store approximate values, not exact values, because of its limited precision.

It typically supports up to 6 to 7 significant digits of precision (total digits, regardless of whether they are before or after the decimal point).

**Key Points:**
_Single-Precision_ refers to how the number is stored in binary format.

It allocates 32 bits for the number:
1 bit for the sign (positive or negative).
8 bits for the exponent (which determines the scale or magnitude).
23 bits for the significant digits (the "`mantissa`").

Approximation:

The real type cannot store every single value precisely.
It's good for numbers where you don’t need perfect precision (e.g., scientific data, measurements, or approximations).

Significant Digits:

It refers to the total number of meaningful digits in the number.

For example:
123.456 (6 significant digits).
0.0001234 (4 significant digits).

`double precision:` A double-precision floating-point number (approx. 15 decimal places).

`serial/bigserial:` Auto-incrementing integers for primary keys.

### 3. Date/Time Types

Used for working with dates and times:

`date:` Calendar date (YYYY-MM-DD).

`time:` Time of day (HH:MI:SS).

`time with time zone:` Same as time but includes a time zone.

`timestamp:` Date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS).

`timestamp with time zone (timestamptz):` Date and time with a time zone.

`interval:` A span of time.
Example: '1 year 2 months'.

### 4. Boolean Type

`boolean:` Stores `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL`.
Example: Used for flags or status indicators.

### 5. Geometric Types

For storing geometric data like shapes, points, and coordinates:

`point:` Represents a geometric point (x, y). Often used for geolocation or Cartesian coordinates.

Example: point(10, 20) represents a point at x=10, y=20.

Usage: You can perform geometric operations, such as:

`SELECT point(3, 4) <-> point(6, 8); -- Calculates distance between points`

`line:` An infinite line.

`lseg:` A line segment.

`box:` A rectangular box.

`path:` A path (open or closed).

`polygon:` A polygon (multi-sided shape).

`circle:` A circle defined by a center and radius.

### 6. Network Types

For storing IP addresses and related information:

`cidr:` IPv4 or IPv6 network block.
Example: '192.168.0.0/24'.

`inet:` IPv4 or IPv6 host or network address.
Example: '192.168.0.1'.

`macaddr:` MAC address.
Example: '08:00:2b:01:02:03'.

### 7. JSON and JSONB

For storing JSON data:

`json:` Text-based JSON.
`jsonb:` Binary representation of JSON, allowing faster querying.

`INSERT INTO table_name (data) VALUES ('{"key": "value"}'::jsonb);`

### 8. Array Types

Allows storing multiple values in a single column.

Example: `int[]` stores an array of integers like `{1, 2, 3}`.

Queries can interact with arrays using special operators:

`SELECT '{1, 2, 3}'::int[] @> '{2}'; -- Checks if 2 is in the array`

### 9. Enumerated Types (ENUM)

A custom list of allowed values.

`CREATE TYPE mood AS ENUM ('happy', 'sad', 'neutral');`

Then use **mood** as a column type.

### 10. Range Types

Represents a range of values:

`int4range`, `numrange`, `daterange`, etc.

Example: `daterange('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31')`.

### 11. UUID

`uuid:` Universally unique identifier.

Example: `'550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'`.

### 12. XML

`xml:` Used for storing XML data.

### 13. Full-Text Search Types

`tsvector:` A searchable document.
`tsquery:` A search query.

### 14. Other Special Types

`bytea:` Binary data (e.g., images, files).
`money:` Currency amounts with a fixed fractional precision.
